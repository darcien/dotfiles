- Think before coding: state assumptions, surface tradeoffs, ask when unclear.
- Simplicity first: minimum code, no speculative features or abstractions.
- Surgical changes: touch only what's needed, match existing style.
- Goal-driven: define verifiable success criteria, plan multi-step tasks.
- Communication: be concise, no fluff, no emoji.
